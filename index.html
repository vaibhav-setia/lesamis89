	   			<p class="lead" style="font-size:20px;text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Right from its inception in 1989, <font face="comic"> Les Amis</font> came to be known as the epitome of excellence, quality and professionalism. With the aim of scratching the hidden talents of students we organized the event “PANORAMA 1991, the inception of a vision...” This was about the birth of a phenomenon. The phenomenon called the <font face="comic"> Les Amis</font> that has now snowballed into a quest for redefining excellence and never looked back after flag shipping “PANORAMA” as an event. <font face="comic">Les Amis </font>is like a temple of discovery, a place where latent skills of an individual can be identified and honed. It’s a sense of great pride in the professional quality of our work coupled with an uncompromising determination to achieve excellence in everything we undertake make us a forerunner in stretching the limits.</p>

The events included a full day crisis committee ‘International Peace Committee’, two fantasy-based committees, one based on Harry Potter and the other on Game of Thrones, each of which had a highly reputable and experienced executive board.  Additional events included a fiction quiz, “You know Nuffin” and a competition that required a blend of art and writing skills, “I AM STAN”.

							<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Carrying forward the legacy of 25 years of excellence, this time we planned FOURTH FRONT which was a Model All India Political Party Meet (AIPPM). This event was held at Chandigarh Judicial Academy, Chandigarh where we witnessed the enthusiastic response of students from different schools and colleges off the tricity. The event provided a platform for candidates to showcase their skills based on diplomacy, debate, politics and governance by placing them in the shoes of leading politicians of the country. We were delighted to welcome Dr. Veer Singh, Director Academic Affairs at Chandigarh Judicial Academy, Shashank Sharma - UN Ambassador of Northern India, Ms. Silky Mittal, alumnus IIM Calcutta and Mr. Surjeet Singh, Ex- IAS Officer as our Chair Committee. The event was an exemplary success that went out to be one of its kind and provided a new horizon especially in terms of learning for the organization as well as for the participation.

I still remember that day, flipping the pages of brochure, searching for what this organization had to offer me and after two years in <font face="comic">Les Amis</font> I can say that this organization gave me the platform I had always been yearning for. I met a group of brilliant and enthusiastic minds, who never missed even a single opportunity to learn from each other. It prepared me for the outside world by putting me in scenarios in and out; always raising the bar one mark higher. I will always cherish the memories <font face="comic">Les Amis</font> has given me.

								<p  style="font-size:20px;text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">&ldquo; “Every brand, product is unique and is majorly defined by its value preposition” <font face="comic">Les Amis</font> truly justifies and lives beyond this dictum for me. It is an induction to a professional world along with the true “masti” which an individual is able to gage in terms of his personal development in all aspects over the span of his <font face="comic">Les Amis</font> tenure. Also, it is a step to network with some really extraordinary talented bunch of people, with whom you develop a strong bond of comradeship for lifetime. It is a platform where one can straight away get to be a part of a decade old organisation weaved with strong ethical values and aspirations, an equal mix of idealism and pragmatism, follows no hierarchy, a positive attitude towards work and life . “It takes a decade to build up, but a lifetime to master” During my stay at the Organisation, I have seen different cycles of learning where I was a team member and how with time I have grown (mastered transferable skills) as a team leader.<font face="comic">Les Amis</font>  for me has not just been a stamp to be decorated on paper, but the epitome of culture and a head start for my future.

							  	<p  style="font-size:20px;text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">&ldquo;The clay mould reaches its final beauty only when it is worked upon with utmost diligence and creativity. As a newly entered college student, one needs to explore multiple dimensions of their character; finally graduating as one fine product. When I joined <font face="comic">Les Amis</font> in second year of college, I never anticipated its end impact, when I would finally graduate. Calling it a professional organization wouldn’t truly justify what it stood for. It is a 25-year old culture with professional value institutionalized into its system. Working with those brilliant minds and teams on multiple problems still brings a smile to my face even after two years in the actual corporate system. I wish I could turn back the clock and work with those minds and teams again that sometimes miss in my current consulting job, but nonetheless I am completely confident sure that this culture is in capable hands and continues to inspire people through throughout their personal & professional lives.

							  	<p  style="font-size:20px;text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">&ldquo;My tryst with <font face="comic">Les Amis</font>  began with the most inadvertent of aims taken at the recruitment in 2011. What followed was a manifestation of freshness and fervour brought into my life by a group of super talented and zelous individuals who used to, work professionally as a team and rejoice as a bunch of buddies. The exposure to practical scenarios that one faces later in life, is an asset that the projects in LA shared with me. Ethics and discipline are two vital cogs which help the organization stand apart from others and for a hard worker, here sky is just the beginning. With the blend of work and fun, one never forgets this surreal journey.
